## Admissions 🎓

This program processes student admissions based on ACT and SAT scores 📊. It checks if scores are within valid ranges, compares them with minimum requirements, and determines if the student is admitted ✅. Results are written to an output file 📝, indicating the reason for admission (ACT, SAT, or both).

### Key Methods:
- **validAct()**: Validates the ACT score 🏅
- **validSat()**: Validates the SAT score 🏅
- **metAct()**: Checks if the ACT score meets the minimum 🔢
- **metSat()**: Checks if the SAT score meets the minimum 🔢
- **admitted()**: Decides if a student is admitted ✔️
- **outputStatus()**: Writes results to an output file 💻
